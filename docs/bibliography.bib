  abstract = {Symbolic regression via genetic programming (GP) was used in the optimisation
	of a pharmaceutical zero-order release matrix tablet, and its predictive
	performance was compared to that of artificial neural network (ANN)
	models. Two types of GP algorithms were employed: 1) standard GP,
	where a single population is used with a restricted or an extended
	function set, and 2) multi-population (island model) GP, where a
	finite number of populations is adopted. The amounts of four polymers,
	namely PEG4000, PVP K30, HPMC K100 and HPMC E50LV were selected as
	independent variables, while the percentage of nimodipine released
	in 2 and 8 h (Y2h, and Y8h), respectively, and the time at which
	90% of the drug was dissolved (t90%), were selected as responses.
	Optimal models were selected by minimisation of the Euclidian distance
	between predicted and optimum release parameters. It was found that
	the prediction ability of GP on an external validation set was higher
	compared to that of the ANNs, with the multi population and standard
	GP combined with an extended function set, showing slightly better
	predictive performance. Similarity factor (f2) values confirmed GP's
	increased prediction performance for multi-population GP (f2 = 85.52)
	and standard GP using an extended function set (f2 = 84.47).},

	Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems [1975, 1992] showed

	the genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm transforms a population

	of reproduction and survival of the fittest and naturally occurring
	genetic operations such as crossover (recombination) and mutation.
