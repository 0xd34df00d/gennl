  abstract = {Modelling processes is an important task in engineering; however,
	the generation of models using only experimental data is not a straightforward
	problem. Linear regression, neural networks, and other approaches
	have been used for this purpose; nevertheless, a mathematical description
	is desirable specially when an optimisation is required. Symbolic
	regression has been used for generating equations considering only
	experimental data. In this paper, two new operators are proposed
	to represent a mathematical model of a process. These operators simplified
	the way for representing equations making possible its use as a symbolic
	regression. The correct model is generated selecting the appropriate
	operators and parameters using an evolutionary algorithm like the
	estimation of distribution algorithms. As a preliminary results,
	three cases are used to illustrated the performance of the proposed
	approach. The results indicates that the use of these alpha, beta
	operators are a promising way to apply symbolic regression to model
	complex process.},

  abstract = {This contribution introduces analytical programming, a novel method
	that allows solving various problems from the symbolic regression
	domain. Symbolic regression was first proposed by J. R. Koza in his
	genetic programming and by C. Ryan in grammatical evolution. This
	contribution explains the main principles of analytic programming,
	and demonstrates its ability to synthesize suitable solutions, called
	programs. It is then compared in its structure with genetic programming
	and grammatical evolution. After theoretical part, a comparative
	study concerned with Boolean k-symmetry and k-even problems from
	Koza{'}s genetic programming domain is done with analytical programming.
	Here, two evolutionary algorithms are used with analytical programming:
	differential evolution and self-organizing migrating algorithm. Boolean
	k-symmetry and k-even problems comparative study here are continuation
	of previous comparative studies done by analytic programming in the
	past.},
