  abstract = {This contribution introduces analytical programming, a novel method
	that allows solving various problems from the symbolic regression
	domain. Symbolic regression was first proposed by J. R. Koza in his
	genetic programming and by C. Ryan in grammatical evolution. This
	contribution explains the main principles of analytic programming,
	and demonstrates its ability to synthesize suitable solutions, called
	programs. It is then compared in its structure with genetic programming
	and grammatical evolution. After theoretical part, a comparative
	study concerned with Boolean k-symmetry and k-even problems from
	Koza{'}s genetic programming domain is done with analytical programming.
	Here, two evolutionary algorithms are used with analytical programming:
	differential evolution and self-organizing migrating algorithm. Boolean
	k-symmetry and k-even problems comparative study here are continuation
	of previous comparative studies done by analytic programming in the
	past.},
