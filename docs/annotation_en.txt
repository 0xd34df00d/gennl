To find an optimal non-linear regression model the author considers a set of
competitive ones. The paper presents an algorithm which inductively generates
non-linear models. An algorithm to generate all advmissible superpositions of
given complexity in finite number of iterations is proposed. The proof of its
correctness is stated. The european option volatility surface illustrates the
proposed method.
