Non-linear autoregression models generation.

* Refresh group theory, familiarize with basics of category theory.
* Read given chapters of McCay (28), Bishop (5), others.
* Begin trying to build a representation of models combinators as group
  operation over a set of NLAMs.

Global:
* Build an algorithm for generating models less than or equal to the
  given complexity (defined as the number of neurons).
* Computing and representing hyperparams of neural nets.
* Computing and interpreting likelyhood.
